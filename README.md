# Cart2Insights-Decoding-E-Commerce-Performance

In today’s digital marketplace, e‑commerce platforms generate vast amounts of data from customer orders, products, sellers, payments, deliveries, and reviews. However, this data often resides in multiple disconnected datasets, making it difficult to derive a unified view of business performance and customer behavior.

Cart2Insights bridges that gap by transforming raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence. The project focuses on analyzing multi‑dimensional e‑commerce data to uncover insights that drive strategic decisions across sales, operations, and customer experience.

STEP 1: Understanding the Business Problem
1. Problem Statement
** Modern e-commerce platforms generate substantial volumes of data across multiple operational domains, including customer orders, product catalogs, seller activity, payment transactions, delivery logistics, and customer reviews. ** However, this data remains fragmented across disparate systems, making it difficult to establish a unified, holistic view of business performance and customer behavior. ** The core challenge, therefore, lies in converting this raw, distributed data into actionable insights capable of informing strategic decision-making. ** In the absence of effective data integration and analysis, organizations face significant obstacles in monitoring overall performance, understanding customer segmentation, optimizing sales and revenue streams, assessing product and seller effectiveness, streamlining delivery operations, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

2. Business Use Cases:
● E-Commerce Performance Monitoring ● Customer Behavior & Segmentation ● Sales & Revenue Optimization ● Product & Seller Performance Analysis ● Delivery & Operational Optimization ● Customer Experience Improvement ● Data-Driven Business Decision Making

3.Detailed Description of Business Use Cases
E-Commerce Performance Monitoring Enable real-time and historical tracking of key business metrics—such as order volume, revenue trends, conversion rates, and platform-wide KPIs—to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive, up-to-date view of overall business health.
Customer Behavior & Segmentation Analyze purchasing patterns, browsing behavior, and demographic data to segment customers into meaningful groups (e.g., high-value customers, frequent buyers, churn-risk segments), enabling targeted marketing and personalized engagement strategies.
Sales & Revenue Optimization Identify revenue trends, high-performing product categories, seasonal demand patterns, and pricing effectiveness to uncover opportunities for maximizing sales and improving profit margins.
Product & Seller Performance Analysis Evaluate product-level metrics (sales volume, return rates, ratings) and seller performance (fulfillment reliability, quality scores, customer feedback) to identify top performers, underperforming listings,and areas requiring intervention.
Delivery & Operational Optimization Assess logistics data—including delivery times, shipment delays, and regional fulfillment performance—to streamline operations, reduce delivery bottlenecks, and improve supply chain efficiency.
Customer Experience Improvement Leverage customer reviews, ratings, and satisfaction metrics to identify pain points in the customer journey and drive improvements in service quality, product offerings, and support processes.
Data-Driven Business Decision Making Consolidate insights from all the above areas into unified dashboards and reports, empowering leadership and cross-functional teams to make informed, strategic decisions backed by data rather than intuition.
4. Understand the business context:
An e-commerce platform facilitates the online sale of products. So, generates substantial volumes of data across several interconnected areas:

Customers and their order history Products and sellers Payments and revenue Deliveries and shipping logistics Customer reviews and satisfaction ratings.

This data resides across multiple related datasets.When analyzed collectively rather than in isolation, it enables a comprehensive understanding of business performance and highlights areas with the greatest potential for improvement.

5. Identify the key business objectives
Monitor performance —
Track revenue, order volume, customer growth, seller activity, average order value, and review scores over time to maintain visibility into overall business health. Understand customers —
Identify who is purchasing, how much they spend, and distinguish between repeat and one-time buyers to inform retention strategy. Optimize sales —
Determine which product categories, individual products, and geographic regions contribute most significantly to revenue generation. Evaluate sellers and products —
Assess performance across revenue, order volume, and customer ratings to identify top performers as well as underperforming sellers or listings. Improve delivery operations —
Measure delivery times and delay patterns to pinpoint where fulfilment processes break down and impact customer experience. Enhance customer experience — Determine the underlying drivers of review scores and customer satisfaction. Enable data-driven decision-making — Deliver consolidated insights through a centralized SQL data warehouse supported by a live, interactive dashboard. Support risk management —
Proactively flag underperforming sellers, delivery regions, or product categories before they materially affect revenue or brand reputation. Benchmark growth over time —
Establish baseline metrics and trend lines that allow performance to be tracked against historical periods and business targets.

6. Define the questions the analysis should answer
Theme Key Business Questions

Business Overview What is the platform's total revenue and order volume to date? How many unique customers and sellers are active on the platform? What is the average order value, and what is the average customer review score?

Sales & revenue How does monthly revenue trend, and how has it evolved over time? Which categories, products, and locations contribute most to overall revenue? What is the average order value, and how does it vary across segments?

Customers What proportion of customers are repeat buyers versus one-time purchasers? How is customer spend distributed across the base? Who are the top customers by value, and what characterizes them?

Products & sellers Which products generate the highest sales volume and revenue? Which sellers drive the most revenue, orders, and customer satisfaction? How do ratings vary across sellers and product categories?

Payments Which payment methods and installment patterns are most commonly used? Is there a relationship between payment method and order completion or cancellation status?

Delivery What is the average delivery time across orders? What proportion of deliveries are late, and by how much? Which regions experience the slowest fulfilment?

Satisfaction What does the distribution of review scores look like? Does late delivery correlate with lower ratings? Which product categories receive the most negative reviews, and why?

Business growth What specific actions can improve revenue performance and customer experience? Which underperforming areas present the greatest opportunity for improvement?

7. Statistically Tested Business Questions (Hypothesis-Driven)
These three statistical questions are being acted on:

Business Question Statistical Test
1 Do delayed orders receive significantly lower review scores than on-time orders? Independent two-sample t-test 2 Does average order value differ significantly across product categories? One-way ANOVA 3 Is there a significant association between payment method and order status? Chi-square test of independence

STEP 2: Understand the Dataset and ER Diagram
2.1 Overview of the Dataset
The Cart2 Insight project uses an e-commerce dataset containing 9 related tables. These tables capture information about customers, orders, products, sellers, payments, reviews, product categories, and geographical locations.

The main purpose of understanding the dataset and Entity-Relationship (ER) structure is to identify how the tables are connected and determine the correct keys and relationships before performing data cleaning, SQL loading, analysis, and feature engineering.

The nine tables are:

Customers
Geolocation
Orders
Order Items
Order Payments
Order Reviews
Products
Sellers
Product Category Translation
2.2.Understanding the 9 Tables
2.2.1. Customers
The customers table contains information about customers who placed orders.

Important columns:

Column	Data Type	Description	Key
customer_id	VARCHAR	Unique identifier for the customer/order record	Primary Key
customer_unique_id	VARCHAR	Identifier associated with the customer across orders	—
customer_zip_code_prefix	INT	Customer ZIP-code prefix	Foreign Key
customer_city	VARCHAR	Customer city	—
customer_state	VARCHAR	Customer state	—
Rows: 99,441 Primary Key: customer_id

2.2.2 Geolocation
The geolocation table contains geographical information associated with Brazilian ZIP-code prefixes.

Column	Data Type	Description	Key
geolocation_zip_code_prefix	INT	ZIP-code prefix	Primary Key
geolocation_lat	DECIMAL	Latitude	—
geolocation_lng	DECIMAL	Longitude	—
geolocation_city	VARCHAR	City	—
geolocation_state	VARCHAR	State	—
Rows: 738,327

The ZIP-code prefix is not unique, so it was not used as a primary key. Check Result Total rows 1,000,163 Unique zip_code_prefix values 19,015 Prefixes appearing more than once 17,972 Prefixes appearing exactly once 1,043

Only about 5% of ZIP prefixes are unique in this table. The rest repeat dozens or even hundreds of times — for example, ZIP prefix 24220 appears 1,146 times, and 24230 appears 1,102 times, each with different latitude/longitude values.

This confirms the original statement: since zip_code_prefix maps to many rows (many distinct lat/lng points, and occasionally slightly different city/state entries), it cannot serve as a primary key on its own — a primary key must uniquely identify each row, and this column doesn't.
2.2.3. Orders
The orders table contains the main order-level information and connects customers with the order lifecycle.

Column	Data Type	Description	Key
order_id	VARCHAR	Unique order identifier	Primary Key
customer_id	VARCHAR	Customer associated with the order	Foreign Key
order_status	VARCHAR	Current order status	—
order_purchase_timestamp	DATETIME	Date and time when order was placed	—
order_approved_at	DATETIME	Payment approval timestamp	—
order_delivered_carrier_date	DATETIME	Date order was handed to carrier	—
order_delivered_customer_date	DATETIME	Date order reached customer	—
order_estimated_delivery_date	DATETIME	Estimated delivery date	—
Rows: 99,441 Primary Key: order_id Foreign Key: customer_id → customers.customer_id

2.2.4. Order Items
The order_items table contains individual products included in each order.

Column	Data Type	Description	Key
order_id	VARCHAR	Order identifier	Foreign Key
order_item_id	INT	Item sequence within an order	Primary Key
product_id	VARCHAR	Product identifier	Foreign Key
seller_id	VARCHAR	Seller identifier	Foreign Key
shipping_limit_date	DATETIME	Seller shipping deadline	—
price	DECIMAL	Product price	—
freight_value	DECIMAL	Freight/shipping cost	—
Rows: 112,650 Primary Key: (order_id, order_item_id) Foreign Keys:

order_id → orders.order_id
product_id → products.product_id
seller_id → sellers.seller_id
2.2.5. Order Payments
The order_payments table contains payment information for orders.

Column	Data Type	Description	Key
order_id	VARCHAR	Order identifier	Foreign Key
payment_sequential	INT	Sequence number of payment	Primary Key
payment_type	VARCHAR	Payment method	—
payment_installments	INT	Number of installments	—
payment_value	DECIMAL	Payment amount	—
Rows: 103,886 Primary Key: (order_id, payment_sequential) Foreign Key: order_id → orders.order_id

**Important project note: ** payment_value is used for payment analysis but not for calculating total order revenue. For this project, total order value is calculated as:    price + freight_value summed across the items belonging to an order.
2.2.6. Order Reviews
The order_reviews table contains customer review information.

Column	Data Type	Description	Key
review_id	VARCHAR	Review identifier	Primary Key
order_id	VARCHAR	Associated order	Foreign Key
review_score	INT	Customer rating from 1 to 5	—
review_comment_title	VARCHAR/TEXT	Review title	—
review_comment_message	TEXT	Review message	—
review_creation_date	DATETIME	Review creation date	—
review_answer_timestamp	DATETIME	Review response timestamp	—
Rows: 99,224 Primary Key: review_id
Foreign Key: order_id → orders.order_id
2.2.7. Products
The products table contains information about products sold on the platform.

Column	Data Type	Description	Key
product_id	VARCHAR	Unique product identifier	Primary Key
product_category_name	VARCHAR	Original product category	Foreign Key
product_name_length	INT	Length of product name	—
product_description_length	INT	Length of product description	—
product_photos_qty	INT	Number of product photographs	—
product_weight_g	DECIMAL	Product weight in grams	—
product_length_cm	DECIMAL	Product length	—
product_height_cm	DECIMAL	Product height	—
product_width_cm	DECIMAL	Product width	—
Rows: 32,951

Primary Key: product_id Foreign Key: product_category_name product_category_name → product_category_translation.product_category_name

2.2.8. Sellers
The sellers table contains information about sellers.

Column	Data Type	Description	Key

seller_city	VARCHAR	Seller city	—
seller_state	VARCHAR	Seller state	—
Rows: 3,095

Primary Key: seller_id Foreign Key: seller_zip_code_prefix
2.2.9. Product Category Translation
The product_category_translation table maps the original Portuguese product category names to English category names.

Column	Data Type	Description	Key
product_category_name	VARCHAR	Original category name	Primary Key
product_category_name_english	VARCHAR	English category name	—
Rows: 73 Primary Key: product_category_name

Two categories referenced by products were added during SQL preparation because they were missing from the original cleaned category file. This allowed the product-category foreign-key relationship to be maintained.

2.3. Identify Primary Keys and Foreign Keys
Identify Primary Keys
Primary keys uniquely identify records within each table.

Table	Primary Key
customers	customer_id
geolocation	geolocation_zip_code_prefix
orders	order_id
order_items	order_item_id
order_payments	payment_sequential
order_reviews	review_id
products	product_id
sellers	seller_id
product_category_translation	product_category_name
2.4 Identify Foreign Keys
The major foreign-key relationships in the database are:

Child Table	Foreign Key	Parent Table	Parent Key
orders	customer_zip_code_prefix	customers	customer_id
order_items	order_id	orders	order_id
order_items	product_id	products	product_id
order_items	seller_id	sellers	seller_id
order_payments	order_id	orders	order_id
order_reviews	order_id	orders	order_id
products	product_category_name	category_translation	product_category_name
sellers	seller_zip_code_prefix	geolocation	geolocation_zip_code_prefix
customers	customer_zip_code_prefix	geolocation	geolocation_zip_code_prefix
All relationship in the table above is a valid, enforceable foreign key, since each parent key listed is a true primary key.

2.5. Understanding the Relationships between table
Understanding how these tables relate to one another is essential before any cleaning, warehousing, or analysis can begin.

The nine tables in this dataset are not independent — together, they form a single, connected structure that traces the complete lifecycle of an order, from the moment a customer places it to the moment they leave a review.

Step 3:
3.1 Load the Raw Data
The objective of this step is to load all raw CSV files into Python using Pandas and understand the initial structure of the dataset before performing data cleaning and preprocessing. To ensure that the dataset working with is accurate, consistent, and ready for meaningful analysis or modeling.In other words, it transforms raw, messy data into a reliable form that can produce trustworthy insights

For each dataset, the following checks were performed:

Number of rows and columns Column names Data types Basic structure of the data Identification of potential data-quality issues

The raw datasets were loaded using the Pandas library

3.2 Check shape, columns, and data types
Loop through each DataFrame to check shape, columns, and data types

3.3 Understand the structure of each table
This check gives overview of each raw dataset before cleaning. Helps to find how many rows/columns exist, what fields are available, and whether you need to handle missing values or type conversions.

STEP: 4 Data Quality Analysis
The objective is to systematically assess the quality of the raw e-commerce datasets before performing data cleaning and transformation.

Step 11: Generate Business Insights
Project Findings Summary
This project has produced the following major findings: Revenue

Total revenue: ₹15,843,553.24 Total orders: 99,441 Average order value: ₹160.58

Sales Trend Revenue generally increased throughout 2017 and into 2018. November 2017 recorded the highest monthly revenue, at approximately ₹11.79 lakh. September 2018 appears to represent an incomplete reporting period.

Product Categories
Health & Beauty, Watches & Gifts, Bed, Bath & Table, Sports & Leisure, and Computers & Accessories were among the highest-revenue categories. ANOVA testing confirmed statistically significant differences in category-level spending (F = 153.796, p < 0.001).

Delivery
The average delivery time was 12.50 days. Of all orders, 89,941 were delivered on time or early, while 6,535 were delayed. Delayed orders recorded an average review score of 2.27, compared with 4.29 for on-time or early deliveries — a difference confirmed by a t-test (p < 0.001).

Customer Experience
The overall average review score was 4.09 out of 5, with 5-star reviews forming the largest group. Delivery delays showed a strong negative relationship with review scores.

Customer Behavior
The dataset classifies all customers as new customers. This reflects an important limitation of the Olist dataset: the customer_id field is effectively order-specific, meaning repeat-customer behavior cannot be reliably inferred from this field alone.

Payment & Order Status
A Chi-Square test indicated a statistically significant association between payment method and order status (χ² = 677.083, p < 0.001). However, since 45% of expected cell counts were below 5, this result should be interpreted with caution.

Step 2 — Translating Findings into Recommendations
The following recommendations connect each finding directly to a corresponding business action:

Finding Business Recommendation
Delayed orders have much lower ratings Improve delivery monitoring and identify delayed shipments early Some states have substantially longer delivery times Investigate logistics performance and carrier coverage by region Spending varies significantly by category Apply category-specific pricing, promotions, and inventory strategies Revenue shows strong seasonal variation Plan inventory and marketing efforts around high-revenue periods High-revenue categories contribute substantially to sales Maintain availability and closely monitor stock levels in these categories Overall review score is 4.09/5 Maintain current service quality while focusing improvement efforts on low-rated orders Customer repeat behavior cannot be reliably measured Adopt a stable customer identifier to enable future retention analysis Payment/order-status Chi-Square result has sparse cells Monitor payment-status patterns, but avoid drawing strong conclusions from this test without further analysis
